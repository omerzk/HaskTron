# HaskTron

![Alt text](./src/open.png "Opening Screen")

HaskTron is an implementation of tron in Haskell using Helm as it's game engine .

  - Functional reactive programming imitating elm's style
  - Simple game design open to massive extension


currently I'm dealing with a few issues holding this game back:

> an abnormal amount of cpu (80%+ on the main game screen) used, most likely stemming  from the engine itself.
> 
> dynamically linked lib's/dependencies prevent the game from running/compiling on most machines
